# Subject To Change

A management sim that blends **wrestling promotion** strategy with the **loop and depth of football/championship manager** titles. Build your roster, book compelling shows, balance egos and budgets, and grow your brand season over season.

---

## 🎯 Vision

- Capture the *“spreadsheet drama”* of sports managers in a wrestling context.
- Player agency through **booking choices**, **talent development**, and **long-term planning**.
- Systems-first design: events, morale, injuries, contracts, finances, and momentum.

---

## 🧠 Key Systems (Prototype)

- **Rosters & Contracts** — Hire, renew, and release. Attributes drive value and match quality.
- **Booking** — Card builder with main/undercard logic, angles, momentum, chemistry.
- **Morale & Ego** — Push too hard or bury stars and you’ll feel it in the locker room.
- **Finance** — Gates, merch, broadcast, and expenses create meaningful trade-offs.
- **Progression** — Training, traits, injuries, and form arcs across a season.

## 🛠 Tech

- **Engine:** Unity (C#)
- **Focus:** Systems design, data-driven architecture, testability

## 🚧 Status

Early prototype. Core loops and data structures first, UI iterating after. The goal is a playable booking → event sim → progression loop, with depth added incrementally.

## 🗺 Roadmap (Short-Term)

- [ ] Data model for talents, contracts, shows, and segments
- [ ] Booking pipeline → event simulator → results screen
- [ ] Morale/chemistry interactions that meaningfully affect outcomes
